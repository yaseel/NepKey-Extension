Privacy Policy for NepKey

Effective Date: 2025.02.12.

Overview

NepKey is a browser extension designed to simplify the login process to essential ELTE portals. This Privacy Policy explains what data is stored by NepKey, how that data is used, and how it is kept secure.

Information We Collect

NepKey collects authentication information that you voluntarily enter in order to use the auto-login features. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Login Credentials: Your Neptun code, passwords, and OTP (one-time password) secret.

How We Use Your Information
- Local Auto‑Login: The collected authentication information is used solely to auto-fill login forms for ELTE portals such as Neptun, Canvas, and TMS.
- Local Storage Only: All data is stored locally in your browser’s storage and is not transmitted to any remote servers or third parties.
- No Tracking: NepKey does not collect any personally identifiable information (e.g., name, address, email), health information, financial information, location data, web history, or user activity beyond what is necessary for the auto-login functionality.

Data Storage and Security
- Local Storage: All authentication data is stored locally on your device. It is not shared with any external service.
- Security Practices: We do not use any remote code or external servers to process your information. All processing occurs on your device, ensuring that your data remains under your control.

Your Control and Rights
- Data Deletion: You can remove your authentication data at any time by clearing the browser’s storage or by uninstalling NepKey.
- Opt-Out: If you do not wish to use the auto‑login features, you can choose not to enter your credentials into NepKey.
